This is the backend to my A.I. based social media content generator. 

The primary code is held inside app/ , with API routes existing in app/routes. The files outside of routes in app are mostly for SQL, async (celery/redis) and auth purposes. 

The generator is held on the website https://socialai.paddymgregory.com/ , and the link to the supporting google chrome extension can be found here 

The following systems design template is what I used, supporting my tech stack of FastAPI, PostGreSQL, OpenAI API, Celery/Redis for async and react/vite for frontend.
